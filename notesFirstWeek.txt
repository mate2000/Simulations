Example of modeling method:
 
- N-body system, molecular dynamic
- Mathematical equation, ODE, PDE
- Monte-Carlo methods(equilibrium, dynamic, kinetic)
- Cellular Automata and Lattice Boltzmann methods
- Multi-agents systems
- Discrete Events simulation 
- Complex networks 

-----------------Space and time Simualtion------------------- 
 - Natural processes occurs in space and evolve over time
 - Sometimes one is only intersted in the time evolution regardless of the spatial location
 - To capture the temporal dimension in a model are several ways:
     Note(Time takes any real values)only mathematical models can deal with this approach[differential ecuation])
     
     -The duration of the process is broke up in small times interval (delta t), the time is discretize but the process is followed continuosly
     -Alternatively we can only focus on the interesting moment of a process, the time is not dicretize but the evolution of a system broke up according to events this is the so-called(Discret-event-Simualtion[DES]) approach 
 
 -To include the spatial dimensions in a model,there are also different ways:
   
   -Eulerian approach: We can take the point of view of an observer who sits at a fixed position x in space and records what he sees(Examples: local atmospheric pressure[p(x,t)], numbers of cars that passed by every minute)
                       the eulerian approach attach a property of the system at each spatial location 
         Note:Space can be continuos(mathematical model) or discretized in cells, forming a mesh covering the region of interest 
     
     
   -Lagrangian approach: We can give the position of all the objects of interest, as a function of time(Example: the movement of the moon) 
                         in the lagrangian approach the observer take the point of view of the moving object
